Crystal Game using Jquery<br>
Live demo: <a href="https://nbcorrigan.github.io/unit-4-game/">https://nbcorrigan.github.io/unit-4-game</a><br>
*This is a guessing game using numbers where the player will guess with numbers. <br>
*There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.<br>
*The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.<br>
*When the player clicks on a crystal it will add an amount of points to the player's total score.<br>
*The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.<br>
*The amount of points each crystal adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.<br>
*The number of games won and lost will be displayed.<br>
*If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.<br>
*When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.<br>
##Game design note: <br>
*The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120<br>
*Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12<br>
